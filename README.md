<h3>React TypeScript MUI Dashboard</h3>
<p>
    This free and open source admin dashboard template is built for React and it’s bootstrapped from Facebook’s create-react-app. All NPM dependencies are up to date and it contains multiple fully customized components based on the popular frontend components framework, Material-UI.
</p>
<p>
React Typescript MUI Dashboard features a nice classic light & clean design and color scheme.
</p>
<p>
You can customize the color scheme and style by editing a single variables files. This Typescript admin dashboard doesn’t use SCSS stylesheets but the more modern approach with styled-components.
</p>
<p>
We’ve included a few page examples for most used user flows that will give you a solid base for getting started with your new project’s development. With very light modifications you can even integrate React Typescript MUI Dashboard into existing projects giving them a much deserved makeover.
